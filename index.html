    <p id="p1">Tennis is a racket and ball sport played on a court in teams of two-four players. The ball is hollow, made from rubber, and covered in material. Tennis balls have the ability to bounce quite well. The aim of Tennis is to hit the tennis ball over the middle net into your opponentâ€™s side of the court. The opponent must then return the ball to your side of the court. If the opponent is unable to return the ball within the rules of the game, you score points.<br>

        Tennis is an Olympic sport and can be a very competitive game. Tennis is also a spectator sport and thousands will gather around to watch the top players battle it out on the court. A very popular tournament is Wimbledon (played on grass courts), which is held in the little suburban town of Wimbledon in South London, England. There are many home owners who have built a tennis court in their garden because they are regular players and enjoy the activity with their friends and family. If you do not own a tennis court, you can rent one for a couple of hours or use one at leisure centres.</p>
